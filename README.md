Difficulty Levels: Implement different AI difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that utilize different search depths or algorithms. This will allow players to choose a challenge that matches their skill level.

Timer: Add a countdown timer for each player's turn, making the game more challenging and intense.

Power-ups: Introduce power-ups that give players advantages, such as removing an opponent's piece, swapping turns, or placing multiple pieces in a single turn.
